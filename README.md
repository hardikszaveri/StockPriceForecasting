## <h1><b>Stock Price Forecasting</b></h1>

## <h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>
Examining stock market data is both intriguing and potentially lucrative, especially when strong predictive models can lead to significant financial rewards. Although the web is saturated with financial information, finding a well-structured dataset that captures essential stock metrics across various companies can be a challenge.

In this project, we will focus on a New York Stock Exchange dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse/data), which includes critical stock price information—Open, Close, High, Low—alongside the date, symbol, and trading volume. Spanning from 2010 to the end of 2016, this dataset provides a solid foundation for our analysis.

Our goal is to explore these key metrics to identify patterns and trends that can inform our predictive models. By applying advanced analytical techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of stock price movements and uncover actionable insights that could lead to financial success. Join us as we navigate the world of stock price prediction and leverage data-driven strategies for informed investment decisions.

## <h3>Business Objective</h3>
<p>
To effectively forecast future stock price movements, our project aims to develop a predictive model that leverages historical data and relevant market indicators. The following objectives will guide our analysis:

Develop a Predictive Model: Create a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts future stock price movements using historical data and relevant market indicators.

Identify Key Factors: Analyze and identify the key factors and market indicators that significantly influence stock price movements, ensuring the model incorporates these variables.

Enhance Prediction Accuracy: Achieve a prediction accuracy of at least X% (define a specific percentage based on your goals) using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Evaluate Techniques: Explore various modeling techniques (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, regression analysis) to determine the most effective approach for stock price prediction.

Provide Actionable Insights: Deliver actionable insights to stakeholders based on model predictions, enabling informed investment decisions and strategy development.

Continuous Improvement: Establish a framework for ongoing model evaluation and refinement to adapt to changing market conditions and improve prediction performance over time.

## <h3>CRISP - DM Framework</h3>
<p>
 The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a widely recognized framework that facilitates successful data science initiatives. This structured approach encompasses the following key phases:

Business Understanding: Define project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, identifying key stakeholders and their needs.

Data Understanding: Collect initial data and explore its characteristics, identifying data quality issues and assessing relevance.

Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency, transforming it into a suitable format for analysis.

Modeling: Select appropriate modeling techniques based on the problem and data characteristics, building and training models using the prepared data.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance against established success criteria, reviewing the process to ensure all objectives have been met.

Deployment: Implement the model in a production environment, monitoring its performance over time and communicating results to stakeholders.

In this project, we will leverage the CRISP-DM framework to guide our analysis and ensure a systematic progression through each phase. By doing so, we aim to enhance our insights and achieve our objectives more effectively.
